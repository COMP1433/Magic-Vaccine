## Introduction
## Motivation
The very first intuition we choose the topic "Data analysis on the influencing factors of development of Covid-19" is deep interest. There are large number of people in Kong Kong starting to taking the vaccine. Some of the people do not know much about the effectiveness of vaccine. Some of people are questioning about the effectiveness.Therefore, as a group of students who are interested in the facts and truths behind the vaccine. We have strong desire to find out the real impact of the vaccine.

However, before a scientific research is conducted, only interest is not enough. The research topic should be proved to valuable and worthy to discuss. After looking into various papers, we find out that theoritical value and reality research are two main issues which should be taken into consideration. On the theritical side, large number of related paper can be found and "Covid-19" and "related vaccine" are both the hot key words in the accademic library. On the reality side, this topic is proven to be useful because its result will benefit the government and the healthcare organization to take measurement. Also, this topic is closely to the hot and crutial social issue nowadays.
